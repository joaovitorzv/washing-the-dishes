# Why?

As I grow my base of knowledge some topics and stuff that i've learned gets blurred in my
mind and I end up having to take some time and read the docs (or wathever) to "unblur" that
knowledge. <ins>to make that unblurring process more efficient</ins> This repo will serve
as a big documentation of everything I learn and think that should be here.

> **washing-the-dishes?** yes the whole idea of creating this repo was while I was washing-the-dishes
